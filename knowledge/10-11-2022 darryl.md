# Thing I learned
- Power Automate requires a premium account to create a custom connector
- Power Automate also doesn't like arrays. This is the reason I chose to switch to a
  comma-separated string list.
- Even with a fork on Replit, you can configure the remote url to point to the
  original GitHub repo (provided you have access of course).
