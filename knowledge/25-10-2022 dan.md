# Thing I learned
- Replit doesn't like merge conflicts, you have to choose whether to overwrite from GitHub or not if things don't match up
- ExpressJS middleware is really easy to implement, basically just a function in the request chain like any other route, except you can call `next()` to continue with more matching functions. This is great for adding in context in a request e.g. in `routes/investec/auth.js` where the `currentUser` variable gets set from auth headers
